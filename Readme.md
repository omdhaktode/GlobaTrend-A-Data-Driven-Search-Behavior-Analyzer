📘 Project Overview / Explanation:<br>
This project leverages the Google Trends API (via PyTrends) to analyze real-time search interest for a given keyword. It uses powerful visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to present data insights in a visually engaging way.<br>

Key Features:<br>
Users enter a keyword, and the system fetches interest by region, identifies the top 10 countries, and visualizes the data using a bar chart and a choropleth world map.<br>

The interest over time is plotted to show how keyword popularity changes throughout the year.<br>

In the end, the user can enter up to three keywords to compare their trends side by side using line graphs.<br>

This tool can be useful for digital marketers, content creators, data analysts, or business planners looking to understand how interest in specific topics or brands evolves over time and geography.<br></p>
